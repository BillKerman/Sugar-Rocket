# Sugar-Rocket
PROTOTYPE 1
This repository contains the initial design, simulation, and roadmap for a sugar rocket capable of reaching an altitude of 150 meters. The rocket uses a fuel mix of potassium nitrate (KNO3) and sucrose (C12H22O11) in a 65:35 ratio, with passive fin stabilization and a delay-charge-triggered parachute recovery system. 
The project integrates practical engineering principles with simulation software to create an efficient and scalable rocket design.
he design is currently in development, the above .ork is of priliminary design . This design is yet to go several iterations and incorporate traditional control systems, enhanced recovery mechanisms, and payload capabilities for further optimization .
